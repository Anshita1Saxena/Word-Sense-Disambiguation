"It has previously been shown that IL-8 mRNA induction was seen less then 1 h after Tat (72aa) stimulation, and levels remained elevated for up to 24 h, leading to IL-8 protein production [ 102 ] . Along these lines, we have previously shown that the IL-8 gene is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner in cells that express the Tat protein, and the induction is during the S phase of the cell cycle and regulated by stable NF-kB binding to the IL-8 promoter [ 103 ] . When looking for IL-8 at the G1/S border, we found that all Tat containing cells, including PBMCs that were treated with exogenous Tat showed an up-regulation of IL-8 in the supernatant (Figure 4), further implying that results obtained from the H9/Tat system may infact be of general physiological relevance in vivo.",level%1:07:00::
"For example, Pop1p is involved in the control of the RNA levels of the cyclin Cig2p [ 33 ] . While it is unclear whether this effect is mediated at the level of transcription or mRNA stability, the budding yeast F-box protein Met30p was recently shown to regulate the ubiquitylation and activity, but not degradation, of the transcription factor Met4p [ 34 ] . In addition, pop1 mutants display an increased rate of chromosome loss, a phenotype that is not easily explained by accumulation of Rum1p and Cdc18p [ 23 ] . Finally, pop1 mutants are sensitive to UV irradiation, whereas pop2 mutants are not (D.",level%1:07:00::
(1) The over-expression levels of mutants were analyzed with SDS-PAGE to ensure that the mutations did not result in changes in the over-expression levels of the enzymes.,level%1:07:00::
"The obvious answer is that mutations provide escape not from direct B-cell immunity but from other levels of immunity, such as T-cell immunity [including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presentation] or indirect Ab immunity via Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (where gp120 molecules found on infected cell surfaces are monomers).",level%1:26:01::

"The present model takes this into account by raising the criteria appropriately at the low expression range, i.e. a higher fold change at low expression levels is required for a gene to be considered differentially expressed.",level%1:07:00::
The conclusion that highly expressed genes will rarely have a 2-fold change in mRNA levels and that lowly expressed genes will commonly have a greater than 2-fold change led to the development of a model that would accommodate for this real biological characteristic of gene expression measurements.,level%1:07:00::
This confidence level could be raised or lowered according to the level of confidence desired by altering the p value.,level%1:07:00::
"The inverse also holds true, where highly expressed genes, having less error in their measured levels, may not meet an arbitrary fold-change cut-off of 2.0 even when they are truly differentially expressed [ 12 ] . Therefore, selecting differentially regulated genes based only on a single fold change across the entire range of experimental data preferentially selects lowly expressed genes [ 8 ] . This commonly used approach does not accommodate for background noise, variability, non-specific binding, or low copy numbers- characteristics typical of microarray data which may not be homogeneously distributed.",level%1:07:00::
The method developed herein includes: (A) determination of the upper X% of highest fold changes within narrow bins of absolute expression levels in order to generate a limit fold change (LFC) function; and (B) subsequent ranking of genes by a combined fold change/absolute expression calculation.,level%1:07:00::
(A) Selection of the upper X% of highest fold changes within binned absolute expression levels,level%1:26:01::
The advantage of the ratio method was that it usually reduced the within-group variance so that the same mean difference between young and old was associated with a higher level of statistical significance.,level%1:07:00::
"When relative expression levels were computed by the ratio method, all means were close to 1 regardless of the absolute signal intensity.",level%1:07:00::
"When no presence / absence filter was applied, the highest-ranked differences had false detection rates of 30% even with the ratio method, and only 34 genes achieved this level.",level%1:07:00::
"The next step was to compute, for each target, the expression level ( R ) of the baseline array relative to all 12 arrays included in the study.",level%1:07:00::

The most common way of understanding gene functions by expression profiling is to study the change of their expression levels in various disease states and cellular environments.,level%1:26:01::
"Furthermore, neural networks, through a strategy of train and differentiate, bring that information to the fore by progressively focusing on the genes within the larger set which are most responsible for the correct classifications, providing at once a reduction in the noise level and specific donor profiles.",level%1:26:01::
"Therefore, any variation in gene expression levels across the two generations should be due to the chip technology itself and the specificity of the probe set sequences.",level%1:26:01::
Both the S33A and S37A mutations displayed slightly higher basal levels of transcriptional activity than the wtp53 protein.,level%1:26:01::
"Since Tag did not decrease simultaneously with an increasing G 1 time, and since Tag was one of the G 1 rate-limiting molecules, the activity of Tag must have been decreasing while Tag levels increased.",level%1:26:01::
"This effect is predictive of the plateau growth phase levels of Tag and thus, ultimately should affect, in the case of Tag or similar oncogenes, the fate of clones in polyclonal populations.",level%1:26:01::
We asked whether Tag expression in immortalized mouse cells always increased as a function of G 1 time during exponential growth and whether levels eventually decreased or achieved a steady state level at high cell density.,level%1:26:01::
"Accordingly, the myristoylation results (Figure 6Aand 6B, lanes 5 and 6) strongly suggested that α i2 and sα i2 are translated equally well, as evidenced by similar levels of radiolabeled myristate incorporation during the labeling period, but sα i2 is more rapidly degraded, as seen by reduced steady-state levels of immunoprecipitated protein.",level%1:26:01::
"Incubation at 33°C results in significantly higher levels of green fluorescence (unpublished data), presumably because of better folding of the jellyfish GFP.",level%1:26:01::

"In contrast, co-transfection with a DFz2 plasmid augmented Wg signaling more than 1000-fold above control levels and about 30-fold above levels observed with Wg alone, suggesting that DFz2 was required for efficient Wg signaling and, although detectable in S2 cells, was present in limiting amounts.",level%1:26:01::

"Rate constancy was assessed using a chi-square test [ 22 ] under increasing stringency (5, 10, 40% significance levels); p-values were recorded for each protein.",level%1:26:01::
Proteins determined to be rate constant at different significance levels were concatenated and analyzed in MEGA2 [ 29 ] . Nematode position and evolutionary distance were determined for each concatenation.,level%1:26:01::
"Indeed, a recent report is consistent with this idea in suggesting that the number of protein-protein interactions significantly affects rates of evolution [ 4 ] .
