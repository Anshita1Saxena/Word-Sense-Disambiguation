"The capability to compete increasingly depends on an enterprise’s ability to manage operations according to the logistics of time and flow of product, reducing time to market and the costs of holding inventory.",time%1:28:05::
Our research suggests that the cycle time of a fast production line should be no more than a week or two to be an effective alternative for the lower costs of a long-cycle line or plant.,time%1:28:05::
"With the establishment of an independent operating unit, Federated Logistics, this retailer reduced the amount of time required to process merchandise in distribution centers by 60 percent, to an average of two days.",time%1:28:05::
"A retailer’s decision about what to stock will depend on a variety of considerations, including the demand forecast for the product, the level of product availability it wishes to provide to customers, the frequency with which it will place replenishment orders, and the lead time to acquire replenishment units.",time%1:28:05::
"Once again, if lead times are uncertain, retailers must hold additional safety stock to meet demand in the event of an unusually long lead time.",time%1:28:05::
"It can be shown that high variability in lead time means higher costs for retailers than somewhat longer, but more reliable lead times; that is, it may be better to have a longer reliable lead time than an unpredictable one with a shorter average duration.",time%1:28:05::
"But given the increasingly short lead times dictated by retailers (often just a couple of days), most manufacturers cannot produce in this way.",time%1:28:05::
"Similarly, the impact of alternative methods for reducing plant cycle time depends not only on the direct costs of changes, but also on the reductions in inventory levels allowed by shorter lead times.",time%1:28:05::

Here we will show how a decision tool can be used to make the transition from general intuition to specific decisions about (1) which products to make in each plant and (2) how to schedule the time and quantity of production for each product.,time%1:28:05::

"This hypothesis asserts that the trajectory of states leading from the initial state in a long stringlike “walk” will, over time, spend as much time in any small 6N cube as in any other cube.",time%1:28:05::
"Since vastly many more small cubes correspond to the nearly uniform distribution of particles, moving in all possible directions but bunched around an average velocity, it follows from the ergodic hypothesis that the system will have spent most of its time in this “equilibrium” macrostate.",time%1:28:05::
"The second law, in its modern understanding, is simply the statement that an isolated thermodynamic system will tend to flow away from improbable macrostates = corresponding to very few of our tiny 6N-dimensional cubes = and flow into and spend most of its time in the equilibrium macrostate for no better reason than that that macrostate corresponds to vastly many small 6N cubes in the entire 6N-dimensional phase space.",time%1:28:05::
